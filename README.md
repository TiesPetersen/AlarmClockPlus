# AlarmClock+
The AlarmClock+ is just like a normal alarm clock, but with a ton of new [features](#features). I would snooze my old alarm clock 4 times before getting out of bed, so I build this new alarm clock. This alarm clock will wake you up and get you out of bed in no time. <br>

This is the first time I built something using an Arduino. The alarm clock consists of electrical components (switches, leds and sensors), an Arduino Nano and 3D printed parts. It took around 2-3 months to build the AlarmClock+, and with that came a lot of prototyping, experimenting and head-scratching, but as a result I learned incredibly much.

## What have I learned?
But what exactly did I learn in those 2-3 months building the alarm clock?

# AlarmClock+
The AlarmClock+ is just like a normal alarm clock, but with a ton of new [features](#features). I would snooze my old alarm clock 4 times before getting out of bed, so I build this new alarm clock. This alarm clock will wake you up and get you out of bed in no time. <br>
This is the first time I built something using an Arduino. The alarm clock consists of electrical components (switches, leds and sensors), an Arduino Nano and 3D printed parts. It took around 2-3 months to build the AlarmClock+, and with that came a lot of prototyping, experimenting and head-scratching, but as a result I learned incredibly much.

## What have I learned?
But what exactly did I learn in those 2-3 months building the alarm clock? 
- Modeling using SketchUp
- 3D printing
- Prototyping quickly
- Building electric circuits
- Using C++ to program the Arduino

## Endresult

### Features
- Displaying the time
- Changing the colour and brightness of the leds
- Changing the time
- Standard Alarm<br>
  This alarm works the same as any other alarm. You are woken up at the same time every day.
- Scheduled Alarm<br>
  This alarm will wake you up at the time you tell it to on that specific day of the week. For example, you want an alarm at 6:55 on monday until friday and no alarm on saturday and sunday.
